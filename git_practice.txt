Just practicing vim and my git familiarity.

Still reckon I've got a very long road ahead of me.

One thing I know for sure is that I'm sick to death of annihilating my back at my current job.

I hope that with some time and practice I'll be able to transition into a career where I can use my mind and my creativity instead of just unga bunga lift rock for the rest of my life.

I know that Jess will support me in my goals. We've got mad love for one another.

Also Ellie just farted and it smells criminally terrible so I'm gonna clear out of the room for a few until it dissipates.
